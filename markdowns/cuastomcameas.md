This add-on offers extensive customization options,

- multiple animations for the filling process, allowing you to choose your favorite style.
- ability to customise the hole filling time or speed.

Note: The hole-filling logic may contain some bugs. Please report any issues you encounter, and if this pack receives your support, I‚Äôll work to improve the logic further!

The idea for this add-on is inspired by a famous java mod called Hole Filler mod!

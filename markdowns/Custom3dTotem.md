## üìö Hole Filler Add-on Documentation

After installing and activating the **Hole Filler** add-on you must type **`?hf`** in the chat. This step is very important and this will give you the tools or items needed to use and customise the add-on.

More spesifically you will get two items, `Hole FIller` and `Hole Filling Setting`. Simply throw the Hole Filler item into any crater, and it will quickly fill the space with blocks.

Note: The hole-filling logic may contain some bugs. Please report any issues you encounter, and if this pack receives your support, I‚Äôll work to improve the logic further!

The idea for this add-on is inspired by a famous java mod called Hole Filler mod!

## More Camera Perspectives

Minecraft comes with only three basic camera perspectives, which work—but for players seeking cinematic creativity, that just isn’t enough.

That’s where this add-on comes in. It introduces a wide range of customizable, dynamic camera perspectives perfect for creators, builders, explorers, and casual players alike.

In version **3.2.0** of this add-on, there are a total of 12 different camera types, and each camera type contains multiple camera perspectives.  
For example, the first type of camera—Dynamic Third Person Back—includes over 12 camera perspectives by itself. You also have the power to create your own dynamic TPP with all the customizations.

So, if we count all the camera perspectives across all 12 camera types, the total comes to **30+ perspectives**. And since every perspective is fully customizable, this add-on technically adds a **countless number** of camera perspectives.

All your customization data is saved permanently, so your settings will never be lost.

### Key Features

**Very User-Friendly Controls**  
    The menu is extremely easy to navigate and use—especially in v3.2.0, where it has been significantly improved.

**Works on All Devices**  
    As long as you're using a supported version of Minecraft Bedrock Edition, this add-on will work smoothly.

**Multiplayer-Supported**  
    This add-on is fully compatible with multiplayer. It's optimized so that every player gets their own personal camera menu, and all customizations are saved separately without interference.

**No Experimental Features Required**  
    You don’t need to enable any experimental features to use this add-on.

**Does Not Disable Achievements**  
    Starting from the 3.2.0 update, this add-on no longer disables achievements making it more survival friendly. (Until Mojang removes this ability)
